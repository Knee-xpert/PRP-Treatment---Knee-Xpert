## PRP Treatment Overview

PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) is a non-surgical treatment that uses your body's own blood to promote healing. It involves extracting a small sample of your blood, processing it to concentrate the platelets, and then injecting it back into the affected area (such as the knee) to accelerate tissue repair and reduce pain and inflammation.

### How PRP Treatment Works
1. **Blood Extraction**: A small sample of your blood is taken, usually from your arm.
2. **Platelet Separation**: The blood is processed in a centrifuge to separate the platelet-rich plasma from other blood components.
3. **Injection**: The concentrated PRP is injected into the injured or inflamed area, such as the knee joint.
4. **Healing Process**: The growth factors in the platelets stimulate tissue repair, reduce inflammation, and promote the healing of cartilage, tendons, and ligaments.

### Benefits of PRP Treatment
- **Non-Surgical**: Avoid the need for invasive surgery.
- **Pain Relief**: Provides significant reduction in joint pain and inflammation.
- **Faster Recovery**: Stimulates healing and regeneration of tissues.
